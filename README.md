# Tabular-Playground-Series-09-2022

Here are notebooks from this competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-sep-2022

I got for notebook.ipynb and notebook2.ipynb the scores 5.43354 and 5.24944 respectively. It gave me 149/1383 place on the private leaderboard.

I think this is not a bad result for my own solution.
